# # Exam grading FAQ
There seems to be quite a bit of confusion on how the core Purdue calculus courses (Calc 1-3) are graded. Here I try to explain how exactly it works.
This is for Calculus 3 (MA261), but the ideas are the same for many others (like Calc 1/2).
## Step 1 - The exams
The process starts with the exams. In Calculus 3, there are two midterms (each out of 100) and a final (out of 200), for a total mark out of 400. This is the *only* metric used for the initial ranking process.
The instructors first determine the mark cutoff for each grade (eg: 335/400 for an A). Then, they rank all the people based on *only* their total grade.
For Calculus 3, out of the ~2400 students, roughly 20-30% people (around 500 - 700 students) will get an A - some of them with an A+, and some with an A-.
## Step 2 - The recitation
Now the grade cutoffs have been determined and a 'grade' has been attached to your name *just based on your exams*. Then your recitation instructor will look at their students, and take your exam-only grade, and add it into a 'basket'. 
As an example, for a recitation of 30 students, assume that 7 students have an A, 7 have a B, 7 have a C, 7 have a D and the remaining poor two students have an F. So the recitation 'basket' contains seven As, seven Bs, and so on.
## Step 3 - Getting your final grade

Now that the recitation 'basket' is done, then your quiz and homework scores are added, and then all students in that recitation will be re-ranked, this time with your **entire** score (out of 550). Then, he'll take the grades from the 'basket'. This means that while they (should!) love all of you and would like to give all their students As if they could, their 'basket' contains only a finite number of As (in this example 7) and hence can only give that many students that grade.
## How does that matter in my final grade?
It depends. Assuming a normal Gaussian distribution, it's unlikely (assuming that you've been doing your homework and have obtained a reasonable quiz score) that if you're doing well above average, that your grade will be impacted. This is because assuming a homework score of 100, the difference between your classmates' scores will be a few points at most. This goes the same way if you're well below average - doing well in quizzes will be unlikely to save you.
**However**, if you're around the median, this could impact your grade, as many of you will be bunched around the C to B region. So considering that many of you will get similar total exam scores, the quiz and HW can make or break a +/- (or a letter grade in very extreme circumstances).

### Example?
Sure. If two students (let's call them Student 1 and 2) have the same exam score of say 260/400 (which could be a C) and another with a score of 250/400 (which can be a C-). Now, let Student 1 and 3 have a quiz+HW score of 145/150, while Student 2 slacked off and got only 125/150. Then the recitation instructor adds up their scores. So,

Student 1's total score: 260 + 145 = 405/550
Student 2's total score: 260 + 125 = 385/550
Student 3's total score: 350 + 145 = 395/550

The recitation instructor now looks at their scores. He has two Cs and one C- to give out. Even though Student 3 did a bit poorer compared to Student 2, the fact that Student 3 did well on the homework means that he overall did better than Student 2, and hence gets the C. Student 2 is hence consigned to a C- and rues himself for not doing his homework.
