## Incarnation 1

It ran for about two to three weeks. Uptake was pretty poor, but we had some good attempts with some entertaining usernames. Here are the winners:


|Quiz|Username|Questions attempted/total (correct)|Score|Number of responses
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Spring 2019 final |"none of your business"  |15/20 (10)|8650|34
|Spring 2018 final|"Mason**************"|12/20 (5)|4920|7
|Fall 2018 final|"no"|7/20 (3)|2790|5
|The Quiz database|"Slut dragon"|24/60 (21)|19140|19

Now that the MA261 cohort of Fall 2019 are done with their finals, the links have been replaced. The quizzes should still work, but will not contribute to the rankings (will though to a different incarnation).
