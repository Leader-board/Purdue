## Incarnation 1

It ran for about two to three weeks. Uptake was pretty poor, but we had some good attempts with some entertaining usernames. Here are the winners:

|Fall 2018 final|"no"|7/20 (3)|2790|5

Now that the MA261 cohort of Fall 2019 are done with their finals, the links have been replaced. The quizzes should still work, but will not contribute to the rankings.
