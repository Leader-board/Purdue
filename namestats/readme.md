# Purdue name statistics

Latest as of September 2021, and hence should include new freshmen who started that year. For some reason I still have access to my account, and hence I'm not quite sure when students lose access to it. Only first/last names with at least 35 occurrences are included. Not all may be humans. 

The legal name (and not your preferred name) is most likely what was considered. Also note that unlike in the UK, people here seem to include their full names (perhaps due to SSN?) and this has to be factored in. Hence the first name is defined as the first word in the name, and the last name is defined as the last word in the name (so a person with a name of ``foo coo boo`` would have their first name as ``foo`` and last name as ``boo``.

Unlike in the past, the full dataset is no longer included, though any Purdue user can generate the full dataset.
