# Purdue name statistics

Latest as of September 2021, and hence should include new freshmen who started that year. For some reason I still have access to my account, and hence I'm not quite sure when students lose access to it. Only first/last names with at least 35 occurrences are included. Not all may be humans. 

Unlike in the past, the full dataset is no longer included, though any Purdue user can generate the full dataset.
