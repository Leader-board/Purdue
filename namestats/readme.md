# Purdue name statistics

Latest as of August 2019, and hence should include new freshmen who started that year.

**Note:** Unlike the one for [St Andrews](https://github.com/Leader-board/St-Andrews/tree/master/namestats), the full data is open for all since Purdue itself has a [public directory](https://www.purdue.edu/directory/).

The full dataset can be seen in Excel format at [here](https://universityofstandrews907-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/dm282_st-andrews_ac_uk/EQJoE5KlNaFKoAveHSfmSTsBQ-QBBFGK_KCNWlIT1i-ZLw?e=hx8M28).
