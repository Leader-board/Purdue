# Purdue name statistics

Latest as of August 2019, and hence should include new freshmen who started that year.

**Note:** Unlike the one for [St Andrews](https://github.com/Leader-board/St-Andrews/tree/master/namestats), more data is open for all since Purdue itself has a [public directory](https://www.purdue.edu/directory/).
