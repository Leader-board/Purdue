# Cutting down on "cool cash" spams

This short guide will tell you how to use Outlook's Rules feature to automatically redirect such emails into junk emails or simply delete them.

This guide is also applicable to the influx of "piano emails" that go like this:

> I'm downsizing and looking to give away my late husbandâ€™s piano to a loving home. The piano is a 2014 Yamaha baby grand. <br>
I will not be checking this email often you can text me to indicate your interest on my private phone number ( 802 378 4554 ) to arrange inspection and delivery with a moving company 

## "Cool cash"?

Yeah, apparently many users' email accounts get hacked and the only thing they send from those accounts are cool cash emails, where they promise students of an easy-looking job that would look quite appaeling for them. It sounds too good to be true, and it is, though I don't know what happens if you fall for it.

And why does Purdue's spam handling system (aka Cisco) not work? Because the filter automatically ignores Purdue email addresses, which is where this junk gets sent from (of course without that user's knowledge).

## If you're using Outlook (desktop)

Firstly, go to Outlook and looks for the *Rules* option (in Home). Click on "Create Rule" and select Advanced Options. Then click the "with specific words in the body" option, add relevant phrases like "cool cash", "personal assistant", "late husband", "baby grand" etc or anything else you see fit.

Then select the action you want, which can simply involve moving to a specific folder (like Spam, Junk or simply one of your own kind), or delete it. Remember that your filter could have the odd false positive (who knows?), so don't delete unless you really want to.

Then Outlook will ask whether you want to configure any exceptions. There shouldn't be any (unfortunately you're not getting real cash from any of them...)
