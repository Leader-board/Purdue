# Cutting down on "cool cash" spams

This short guide will tell you how to use Outlook's Rules feature to automatically redirect such emails into junk emails or simply delete them.

## If you're using Outlook (desktop)

Firstly, go to Outlook and looks for the *Rules* option (in Home). Click on "Create Rule" and select Advanced Options. Then clikc the "with specific words in the body" option, add relevant phrases like "cool cash", "personal assistant" or anything else you see fit.

Then select the action you want, which can simply involve moving to a specific folder (like Spam, Junk or simply one of your own kind), or delete it. Remember that your filter could have the odd false positive (who knows?), so don't delete unless you really want to.

Then Outlook will ask whether you want to configure any exceptions. There shouldn't be any (unless some of them are genuine??).
